<b> What are your expectations of the class? </b><br>
I'm expecting to learn how to use software engineering tools and techniques to build a working website. Since I'm going to be working in a group, I am also expecting to meet new people in my major.<br>
<br>
<b> What did you do this past week? </b><br>
I've been playing a ridiculous amount of Civ VI ever since I got back from the break. Besides that, I went through the usual routines of unpacking my clothes, buying books and paper, and celebrating with some good food- Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken. <br>
<br>
<b> What's in your way? </b><br>
Driving. I am scared of driving but I'm trying to practice. My upcoming job requires me to commute 22 minutes to between Round Rock and Austin, so I have to get comfortable with driving by the end of the semester. I told myself I would practice driving on Saturday, but I ended up wimping out. I'll try again on Tuesday. Even so, just thinking about it makes me anxious and blocks my ability to want to tackle my other responsibilities. I will need support and to get back into my excellent groove.<br>
<br>
<b> What will you do next week? </b><br>
I'm going to dive into my ethical hacking and SWE homework. Most likely, I'll play even more Civ VI. I might skateboard because the weather has been pleasant. I also might spruce up this class blog some. No big events are planned, as usual. <br>
<br>
<b> What's my experience of the class? </b>
My first impressions of Downing were outstanding. He is an engaging lecturer and has made the class easy to follow. Most of my UTCS professors haven't been great lecturers, so I'm glad for that.<br>
I'm not familiar with anyone besides the one friend I dragged in here. Hopefully, I can start to feel more comfortable talking with Professor Downing and my classmates.<br>
<br>
<b> What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
For anyone interested in a cool terminal-based reverse engineering toolkit, <a href=https://medium.com/@jacob16682/reverse-engineering-using-radare2-588775ea38d5>here</a> is a radare2 tutorial.
I tinkered with radare2 several months ago but found it hard to learn. My goal is to learn to reverse engineer with it so that people will pass by, see the flood of ascii graphics on a jet black screen, and pee their pants.<br>
